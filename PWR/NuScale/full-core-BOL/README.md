# NuScale-like Core

This folder includes the full core models of NuScale-like core with the BOL fuel composition. The model is completely based upon the public domain:

> Fridman, E., Bilodid, Y., Valtavirta, V., 2023. Definition of the neutronics benchmark of the NuScale-like core. Nuclear Engineering and Technology 55, 3639–3647. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.net.2023.06.029


The reference solution was obtained via OpenMC 0.13.3 with ENDF/B-VII.1. The result is in good agreement with the reference.
