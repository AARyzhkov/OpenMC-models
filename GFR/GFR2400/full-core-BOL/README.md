# GFR2400

This folder includes the full core models of GFR2400 with the BOL fuel composition. The model is based upon the following work:

> Perkó, Z., Pelloni, S., Mikityuk, K., Křepel, J., Szieberth, M., Gaëtan, G., Vrban, B., Lüley, J., Čerba, Š., Halász, M., Fehér, S., Reiss, T., Leen Kloosterman, J., Stainsby, R., Poette, C., 2015. Core neutronics characterization of the GFR2400 Gas Cooled Fast Reactor. Progress in Nuclear Energy 83, 460–481. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnucene.2014.09.016


The reference solution was obtained via OpenMC 0.13.3 with ENDF/B-VII.1.
